**What is HTML?**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a coding language used to create web pages. It tells web browsers how to structure and display content like text, images, and links. It's essential for building websites.

**Familiarize yourself with HTML** (no worry! even if you do not understand them now!)

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

2. Tag: A markup construct in HTML used to define elements within a document, enclosed by angle brackets, such as \<p> for paragraphs.

3. Element: The combination of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, defining a specific part of a webpage, such as paragraphs (\<p>), headings (\<h1> to \<h6>), and images (\<img>).

4. Attribute: Additional information is provided within the opening tag of an element to modify its behavior or provide metadata, such as src for image source or href for hyperlink reference.

5. Document: A web page created using HTML, typically consisting of a combination of elements structured within a hierarchical format.

6. Head: The portion of an HTML document that contains metadata and links to external resources, including the <head> element.

7. Body: The portion of an HTML document that contains the content visible to users, including text, images, and other media, enclosed within the <body> element.

8. Heading: An HTML element used to define headings or titles within a document, ranging from \<h1> (the highest level) to \<h6> (the lowest level).

9. Paragraph: An HTML element used to define paragraphs of text within a document, enclosed by \<p> tags.

10. Link: An HTML element used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or resources, defined by the \<a> (anchor) tag, with the href attribute specifying the destination URL.

11. Image: An HTML element used to embed images within a document, defined by the \<img> tag, with the src attribute specifying the image source.

12. List: An HTML element used to create lists, including ordered lists (\<ol>), unordered lists (\<ul>), and list items (\<li>).

13. Table: An HTML element used to organize data into rows and columns, defined by the <table> tag, with rows (\<tr>), cells (\<td>), and header cells (\<th>).

14. Form: An HTML element used to create interactive forms for user input, defined by the <form> tag, with input fields (\<input>) and other form elements.

15. Semantic HTML: HTML elements that provide meaning and structure to the content, such as \<header>, \<footer>, \<nav>, \<article>, \<section>, and \<aside>.

16. Div: A generic container element used to group and style content, often used for layout purposes, defined by the \<div> tag.

17. Span: A generic inline container element used to apply styles or mark up a specific portion of text within a larger block of content, defined by the \<span> tag.

18. Inline vs. Block Elements: Inline elements, like \<span> and \<a>, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary, while block elements, like \<div> and \<p>, start on a new line and take up the full width available.

19. Attribute Value: The value assigned to an attribute within an HTML tag, such as "blue" in \<div style="color: blue;">.

20. Comment: An HTML comment is a piece of text within an HTML document that is not displayed in the browser but can be used to provide notes or explanations to developers, defined by the \<!-- --> syntax.
    
21. DOCTYPE: The document type declaration (\<!DOCTYPE html>) specifies the version of HTML used in a document and helps browsers render web pages correctly.

22. Metadata: Information about the HTML document that is not displayed on the page itself, such as the document's character encoding (\<meta charset="utf-8">) or viewport settings (\<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">).

23. Anchor: Another term for a hyperlink, created using the \<a> tag.

24. Empty Element: An HTML element that does not require closing tags, such as \<img>, \<br>, and \<input>, as they do not contain any content between opening and closing tags.

25. HTML Entity: Special codes represent reserved characters in HTML, such as \&lt; for \< and \&amp; for &.

26. Inline Style: CSS styles applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute, such as \<div style="color: red;">.

27. Block vs. Inline Elements: Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available, while inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.

28. Nesting: Placing one HTML element inside another, creates a hierarchical structure, such as placing a \<p> element inside a \<div> element.
