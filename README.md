# What is HTML?

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a coding language used to create web pages. It tells web browsers how to structure and display content like text, images, and links. It's essential for building websites.

# Why should I learn HTML?

### HTML is like the ABCs of web development. It's the basic language you need to create web pages. Without it, you can't even start building a website. So, if you're serious about becoming a web developer, learning HTML is a must.

# What does HTML code look like?

                      <!DOCTYPE html>
                      <html lang="en">
                      <head>
                          <meta charset="UTF-8">
                          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                          <title>My First Web Page</title>
                      </head>
                      <body>
                          <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                          <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                          <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
                          <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a> to visit Example.com.
                      </body>
                      </html>

# Familiarize yourself with HTML (no worry! even if you do not understand them now!)

### *1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):* The standard language for creating web pages and applications.

### *2. Tag:* A markup construct in HTML used to define elements within a document, enclosed by angle brackets, such as \<p> for paragraphs.

**3. Element:** The combination of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, defining a specific part of a webpage, such as paragraphs (\<p>), headings (\<h1> to \<h6>), and images (\<img>).

**4. Attribute:** Additional information is provided within the opening tag of an element to modify its behavior or provide metadata, such as src for image source or href for hyperlink reference.

**5. Document:** A web page created using HTML, typically consisting of a combination of elements structured within a hierarchical format.

**6. Head:** The portion of an HTML document that contains metadata and links to external resources, including the <head> element.

**7. Body:** The portion of an HTML document that contains the content visible to users, including text, images, and other media, enclosed within the <body> element.

8. Heading: An HTML element used to define headings or titles within a document, ranging from \<h1> (the highest level) to \<h6> (the lowest level).

9. Paragraph: An HTML element used to define paragraphs of text within a document, enclosed by \<p> tags.

10. Link: An HTML element used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or resources, defined by the \<a> (anchor) tag, with the href attribute specifying the destination URL.

11. Image: An HTML element used to embed images within a document, defined by the \<img> tag, with the src attribute specifying the image source.

12. List: An HTML element used to create lists, including ordered lists (\<ol>), unordered lists (\<ul>), and list items (\<li>).

13. Table: An HTML element used to organize data into rows and columns, defined by the <table> tag, with rows (\<tr>), cells (\<td>), and header cells (\<th>).

14. Form: An HTML element used to create interactive forms for user input, defined by the <form> tag, with input fields (\<input>) and other form elements.

15. Semantic HTML: HTML elements that provide meaning and structure to the content, such as \<header>, \<footer>, \<nav>, \<article>, \<section>, and \<aside>.

16. Div: A generic container element used to group and style content, often used for layout purposes, defined by the \<div> tag.

17. Span: A generic inline container element used to apply styles or mark up a specific portion of text within a larger block of content, defined by the \<span> tag.

18. Inline vs. Block Elements: Inline elements, like \<span> and \<a>, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary, while block elements, like \<div> and \<p>, start on a new line and take up the full width available.

19. Attribute Value: The value assigned to an attribute within an HTML tag, such as "blue" in \<div style="color: blue;">.

20. Comment: An HTML comment is a piece of text within an HTML document that is not displayed in the browser but can be used to provide notes or explanations to developers, defined by the \<!-- --> syntax.
    
21. DOCTYPE: The document type declaration (\<!DOCTYPE html>) specifies the version of HTML used in a document and helps browsers render web pages correctly.

22. Metadata: Information about the HTML document that is not displayed on the page itself, such as the document's character encoding (\<meta charset="utf-8">) or viewport settings (\<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">).

23. Anchor: Another term for a hyperlink, created using the \<a> tag.

24. Empty Element: An HTML element that does not require closing tags, such as \<img>, \<br>, and \<input>, as they do not contain any content between opening and closing tags.

25. HTML Entity: Special codes represent reserved characters in HTML, such as \&lt; for \< and \&amp; for &.

26. Inline Style: CSS styles applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute, such as \<div style="color: red;">.

27. Block vs. Inline Elements: Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available, while inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.

28. Nesting: Placing one HTML element inside another, creates a hierarchical structure, such as placing a \<p> element inside a \<div> element.

29. Semantic Markup: Using HTML elements that convey the meaning of the content, improving accessibility and search engine optimization.

30. Validation: Checking HTML code for errors and ensuring it conforms to the standards set by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).

31. Whitespace: The space, tab, or newline characters used for formatting and readability within HTML documents. While whitespace is typically ignored by web browsers, it can impact the layout and readability of your HTML code.

32. Escape Characters: Special characters in HTML that have a predefined meaning, such as \< and > for tags. To display these characters as text rather than interpreting them as HTML, you can use escape characters like \&lt; and \&gt;.

33. Semantic Structure: Organizing content using semantic HTML elements such as \<header>, \<footer>, \<nav>, \<main>, and \<article>, which provide meaning and context to different sections of a webpage.

34. HTML5: The latest version of HTML, which introduced new elements, attributes, and APIs to enhance web development, including \<video>, \<audio>, \<canvas>, and \<svg> elements.

35. Responsive Design: Designing web pages that adapt and respond to different screen sizes and devices, achieved using techniques like media queries and flexible layouts in HTML and CSS.

36. Accessibility: Ensuring that web content is accessible to users with disabilities, achieved by using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images (alt attribute), and following accessibility guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

37. SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Optimizing web pages to improve their visibility and ranking in search engine results, achieved by using relevant keywords, descriptive titles, and semantic HTML markup.

38. Deprecated Elements: HTML elements that are no longer recommended for use in modern web development due to being outdated or replaced by newer standards, such as \<font>, \<center>, and \<strike>.

39. Cross-browser Compatibility: Ensuring that web pages look and function consistently across different web browsers, achieved by testing and optimizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for compatibility with popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

40. Whitespace Collapsing: In HTML, consecutive spaces, tabs, and newline characters are collapsed into a single space when rendered by the browser, except within elements styled with CSS to preserve whitespace.

41. Escape Sequences: Special sequences of characters used to represent reserved characters or non-printable characters within HTML, such as &nbsp; for a non-breaking space or &quot; for a double quote.

42. inline Frames (iframes): An HTML element (<iframe>) used to embed another HTML document within the current document. This is commonly used for embedding videos, maps, or other external content.

43. Meta Tags: HTML <meta> tags provide metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding (\<meta charset="utf-8">), viewport settings (\<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">), or specifying keywords and description for search engines.

44. Blockquote: An HTML element (\<blockquote>) used to indicate that a section of text is quoted from another source. It is commonly styled to stand out from the rest of the content.

45. Abbreviation and Acronym: HTML elements (\<abbr> and \<acronym>) used to mark up abbreviations and acronyms in text. They can include a title attribute to provide the full expansion of the abbreviation or acronym.

46. Semantic Elements for Time: HTML5 introduced elements like \<time> for marking up dates, times, or durations in a machine-readable format, enhancing accessibility and search engine understanding.

47. Web Standards: Guidelines and specifications set by organizations like the W3C to ensure interoperability and compatibility among web technologies. Adhering to web standards promotes consistency and accessibility in web development.
